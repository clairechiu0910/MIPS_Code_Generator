In this assignment, I use ANTLR to generate a code generator for MIPS processors.
I use an integer counter to maintain the ten general registers $t0-$t9 for expression evaluation, and I assume that 10 registers are enough to evaluate every expression in the program.
I also return all the registers used to evaluation and expression back after evaluating anexpression.
The code generator should read input from stdin and writes output to stdout.

To use this code, uou can follow the following steps:
1. Download ANTLR tool
2. Use the ANTLR tool to generate the java code.
	$antlr4 Rose.g4
3. Compile the generated java code.
	$javac Rose*.java
4. Use the ANTLR tool to execute the generated byte code.
	$grun Rose program
